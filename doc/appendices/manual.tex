\subsection{Signup and Login Process}
From the Home Page, users can initiate the authentication process by selecting the \textit{"Sign In"} option located at the top-right corner of the interface.

	\caption{Patient Registration Form}
	\label{fig:patient-register}
\end{figure}

Upon accessing the registration interface, a patient may create a new account. Alternatively, users who already possess valid credentials can proceed to the login form.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{Patient Login Form}
	\label{fig:login-patient}
\end{figure}

The login interface also provides auxiliary navigation: by selecting the \textit{Register} button, users are redirected to the registration form. Additionally, by selecting the \textit{Forgot Password} option, users can initiate the password recovery process. This procedure simulates the dispatch of a recovery link to the registered e-mail address.

\end{figure}

Once authenticated, the user is redirected to the personalized Patient Home Page. This dashboard provides access to core functionalities including doctor search, profile management, appointment tracking, and the display of favorited doctorsâ€”specifically those who have been reviewed or endorsed by the user. A recommendation system enhances this section by suggesting relevant doctors based on the patient's interaction history.

\subsection{Doctor Profile and Appointment Booking}
By selecting the \textit{"Search for Doctors"} option, users can enter a query string that may consist of a doctor's name, medical specialization, city, province, or a combination of these criteria.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{resources/screenshots/patient_ui/search-doctor.png}
	\caption{Doctor Search Interface}
	\label{fig:search-doctor}
\end{figure}

After performing a search, the user can select a doctor from the resulting list to access the corresponding public profile page.

The doctor's profile page displays information regarding the available types of visits and the corresponding fees. From this page, the user can book an appointment by selecting a specific visit type. An optional note can be attached to the appointment request to communicate additional information to the doctor.

	\label{fig:book-appointment}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, users have the option to endorse the doctor or leave a review. However, reviews are only permitted if the patient has attended at least one appointment with the doctor in question. This ensures the authenticity and reliability of the feedback provided.
